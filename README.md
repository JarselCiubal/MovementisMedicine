# MovementisMedicine
Welcome to the "Movement is Medicine" project! This website promotes the importance of physical activity, showing that movement can be enjoyable and doesn't always mean lifting weights. It features a home section, an about page, a blog (coming soon), and a contact page. Join us in spreading the message that movement is essential for health!
